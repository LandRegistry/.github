### Design System

The [HM Land Registry Design System](https://github.com/LandRegistry/hmlr-design-system) allows you to make digital services and products consistent with users experience and expectations of government, work to government service design standards, and use our styles, components, patterns and guidance for HM Land Registry specific user needs.

We have an [HM Land Registry Frontend](https://github.com/LandRegistry/hmlr-frontend) repository that contains the code you need to start building a user interface for HM Land Registry platforms and services. This is distributed as an [@hmlr/frontend npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hmlr/frontend) to be consumed by your service.

When building a Python application, you can use the [HM Land Registry Frontend Jinja macros](https://github.com/LandRegistry/hmlr-frontend-jinja) in addition to the [GOV.UK Frontend Jinja macros](https://github.com/LandRegistry/govuk-frontend-jinja) to ensure your service adheres to the [GOV.UK Frontend standards](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) and that the [HTML matches GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/testing-your-html/).
